<h3>Introduction to our project (info, goals, complexity, speed, results, simplicity, abstractiveness)</h3>
<h4>
Written digits images classification with Convolutional Autoencoders in Keras
</h4>

<h3>How we run the executables</h3>
<h4>
  To run it with google Colab:

<h3>How we tested that it works</h3>
<h4>
  We tested our (.py) scripts with every possible combination, based on the project requests. For better performance we used google colab which provides powerfull hardware with memory and GPU. Google Colab minimized the time that each experiment took. We tested many hyperparameters' combinations and found some very good models with good performance and small loss. These two were the creterions which we used to consider which experiment was the best.
